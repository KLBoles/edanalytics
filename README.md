## Project Overview:

This project aims to develop and deliver a microcredential program, "Getting Started in Educational Data Analytics Using R", through the College of Education, Health, and Human Sciences (CEHHS) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK).

### Target Audience:

- K-12 and higher education leaders and analysts
- Undergraduate and graduate students in CEHHS and across UTK interested in learning R and data analytics 
- Individuals seeking an introduction to data analytics, R, and its applications in education

**No Prior Knowledge Required**: The program assumes no prior knowledge of programming or statistics, making it accessible to a broader audience.

### Learning Experience:

**Online, Self-Paced Format**: Participants can complete the microcredential at their own convenience.

**Interactive Modules**: Each module features:
- **Code-along Projects**: Learn by doing with step-by-step guides.
- **Formative Assessments**: Reinforce your understanding with built-in quizzes and activities.
- **Engaging Content**: Modules are designed to be informative and enjoyable.

We hope this microcredential will empower educators and analysts with valuable data analysis skills using R and ultimately contribute to improved educational outcomes.
